# Alexandria Book Search Engine

## Description 
---

Todays, finding books is an essential part of human life. Therefore, having a website capable of searching books based on subjects is a useful tool, especially if it has a dashboard capability in order to save the desired books for further reference. All of these can be achieved by using the Alexandria book search engine.
Previously, this software was written based on a "RESTful API", now it has been refactored to be a "GraphQL API built with Apollo Server".

<br>

This application is capable of the following actions:

<br>

1. sign up or login to the application

2. search a book based on a subject

3. save the desired books

4. see the saved books in the user's dashboard

5. delete each one of the saved books if desired
